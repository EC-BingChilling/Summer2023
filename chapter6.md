# Chapter 6 Games
The connectedness of a complex system like a social group, nature, or technology means that different parts of the system are liked together. At the same time, the actions of individuals in the system depend on each other so the outcome for one person is influenced by what another person does. Graph theory is mentioned to discuss the structure of the connections. 

TLDR; things in a system affects other things in the system.
