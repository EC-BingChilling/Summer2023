Public Goods Game (PGG) uses a voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM)

The players are choosing between contributing or not contributing to something considered a public good. Similar to the prisoner's dilema. 

The most logical choice for both evolutionary and traditional game theory is for each person not to contribute (defect), which means nobody puts anything into the public good. 

If we allow people whether or not to participate we will have these strategies:
- cooperate
- not cooperate
- not participate at all

Replicator Dynamics is a method used to study how the strategies evolve over time.   

They found that if there is significant benefits to contributing the strategies go through cycles like rock paper scissors where cooperation, not cooperating and not participating each have turns being more successful which results in higher levels of cooperation in the group.   

No matter which strategy becomes dominant, the average payoff for everyone in the game remains the same as the people who choose not to participate. If cooperation is more common it doesn't mean everyone benefits more than the people who don't contribute.
