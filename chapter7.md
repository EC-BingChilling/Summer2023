# Chapter 7 Evolutionary Game Theory
Many behaviors involve the interactions of organisms in an environment so we have to consider the success of the organisms overall based on their actions. 

Their strategy is the organism's genetically determined characteristics and behaviors and the payoffs depend on strategies (characteristics) of the organisms they interact with.

## 7.1 Fitness as a Result of Interaction
In evolutionary settings, game theory can explain phenomena of why certain features don't exist on certain organisms. 

Ex. Small beetles get a mutation and now some of the population of beetles are small and some of the population of beetles are large. Because the larger beetles have more metabolic requirements they end up having a negative effect on fitness since it needs more food to support itself. Large beetles are likely to be driven out of the population over time through multiple generations. 

### Interaction Among Organisms
Beetles with larger body size are more effective at claiming an above average share of food.

Outcomes:
- Same size = equal share of food
- Large v Small = Large gets majority
- Large experiences less of fitness benefit in all cases from a givern quantity of food because they have a high metabolism

|          |       | Beetle 2 |       |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
|          |       | Small    | Large |
| Beetle 1 | Small | 5,5      | 1,8   |
|          | Large | 8,1      | 3,3   |

We need to think about strategies that operative over longer time scales and shifting over populations because the sizes aren't strategies but instead they're hardwired to one of these stratgies in their lifetime.
