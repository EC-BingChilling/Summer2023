# [Public Goods Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuNrl-QCCTU)
Experiment in which we are trying to understand the characteristics of and behavior of people who behave in a Public Goods interaction

We look at this in a way using a game called voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM). 
- players get a choice between contributing or not contributing to get something acting as a public good

**Payoff Structure**  
Each player's payoff (π) is determined by their endowment (y_i) minus their contribution (c_i) plus a multiplier (M) multiplied by the sum of contributions from all players (Σc_i) to the public good.
Mathematically represented as π_i = y_i - c_i + M * Σc_i for each player i.


**Example**  
If everyone got $10, I contributed $5  
Payoff = 10 - 5 + multiplier*(contribution of all players)   
the $5 gets added to the contribution of all players

M = multiplier(MPCR)   
- marginal per capita return, which represents the return each player recieves for each marginal dollar contributed to the public good

**Characteristics**
- Non exludable: Players can benefit from the public good regardless of their contribution since no one can prevent access
- Non rival: The benefits of the public good remains the same whether or not an individual contributes

The structure of the payoff function contributes to the challenge of cooperation

## [Plugging in numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5AOchKNv5U)
Plugging in some numbers into  
π_i = y_i - c_i + M * Σc_i
m = 0.5  
n = 4  
y_i = 10  

How could this be similar to the prisoner's dilema?  
Options:
- Contribute: 10
- Don't Contribute: 0

There are many other games where people can choose to contribute anywhere from 0 to 10 but for the sake of simplicity, we are using 10 and 0. 

P<sub>1</sub>(C,C)
- If all players contribute, the total public good would be $40 (there is 4 people n 4*10 = 40)

- then we multiply the 40 by 0.5(m) then we will get $20  
player 1 payoff = 10 - 10 + 0.5(4*10) = 20
