# [Public Goods Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuNrl-QCCTU)
Experiment in which we are trying to understand the characteristics of and behavior of people who behave in a Public Goods interaction

We look at this in a way using a game called voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM). 
- players get a choice between contributing or not contributing to get something acting as a public good

**Payoff Structure**  
Each player's payoff (π) is determined by their endowment (y_i) minus their contribution (c_i) plus a multiplier (M) multiplied by the sum of contributions from all players (Σc_i) to the public good.
Mathematically represented as π_i = y_i - c_i + M * Σc_i for each player i.


**Example**  
If everyone got $10, I contributed $5  
Payoff = 10 - 5 + multiplier*(contribution of all players)   
the $5 gets added to the contribution of all players

M = multiplier(MPCR)   
- marginal per capita return, which represents the return each player recieves for each marginal dollar contributed to the public good

**Characteristics**
- Non exludable: Players can benefit from the public good regardless of their contribution since no one can prevent access
- Non rival: The benefits of the public good remains the same whether or not an individual contributes

The structure of the payoff function contributes to the challenge of cooperation
